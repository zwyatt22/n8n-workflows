# n8n Workflows Project

This repository is dedicated to hosting and organizing n8n workflow files, supporting scripts, and documentation. It is structured to make managing, sharing, and deploying workflows easy, and to encourage best practices for automation and integration projects.

```

## Getting Started

1. **Export your n8n workflows** and add them to the `workflows/` directory under a relevant service folder.
2. **Add helper scripts** (e.g., for deployment or syncing) to the `services/` directory.
3. **Document your usage** or architecture in the `docs/` folder.
4. **(Optional) Add custom nodes** you develop to `custom-nodes/`.

## Example

- See `workflows/service1/example-workflow1.json` for a sample workflow file.
- See `services/deploy.sh` for a bash helper script.
- See `custom-nodes/sample-node/index.js` for a custom node scaffold.
